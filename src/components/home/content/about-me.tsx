          I am a self-taught developer who embarked on this journey in 2011 at
          the age of 16. I started exploring programming and programming
          languages and quickly fell in love with them. I learned about HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I began writing scripts to make my work
          more enjoyable (I was working as a Technical Support professional at
          the age of 19) and to automate repetitive tasks.

          When I turned 21, I started working as a web developer and began
          learning about React and Node.js. This was the moment when I started
          delving into software architectures and discovering how to create
          scalable applications, marking the beginning of my adventure in this
          fascinating world.
